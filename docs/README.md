# OctoAcme Project Management Docs README

This README serves as an entry point to all project management process documentation for OctoAcme. Below are links to our core process documents and a summary of the overall project management approach used by the team.

## Overview of Project Management Processes
OctoAcme applies a clear, structured lifecycle across all projects:
- **Initiation:** Validate project need, identify stakeholders & define outcomes.
- **Planning:** Break work into increments, define release roadmaps, address dependencies, prepare backlog.
- **Execution & Tracking:** Use GitHub Projects for daily tracking and delivery syncs; PR and test conventions; monitoring of success metrics and escalation workflow for blockers.
- **Risk & Communication:** Maintain risk registers, provide consistent stakeholder updates, escalate as necessary.
- **Release & Deployment:** Standardized pre-release checks, deployment checklist, rollback playbook.
- **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement:** After each major milestone, review outcomes and action items for improvement.
- **Roles & Personas:** Responsibilities of PM, PdM, Developers and Stakeholders are clearly documented.
